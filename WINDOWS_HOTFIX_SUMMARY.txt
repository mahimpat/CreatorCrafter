CREATORCRAFTER - WINDOWS HOTFIX PACKAGE
================================================================================

QUICK SUMMARY FOR YOU:

The Windows installer has a bug where Python paths are hardcoded for Linux/Mac.
I've created a complete hotfix package for your users.

FILES CREATED FOR WINDOWS USERS:
================================

1. HOTFIX_README.md
   → Main user-facing instructions
   → Copy this to Windows machine and follow steps

2. windows-hotfix.bat
   → Automated Python environment setup
   → Creates venv, installs packages, downloads AI models
   → Run as Administrator

3. windows-diagnostic.bat
   → Diagnostic tool to check what's missing
   → Shows Python, FFmpeg, files status
   → Run first to see what's wrong

4. windows-path-fix.js
   → Automated path patcher
   → Fixes main.js to use Windows paths
   → Requires Node.js on Windows

5. WINDOWS_HOTFIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   → Detailed technical instructions
   → Manual fix steps if automation fails
   → Troubleshooting guide

FILES FIXED IN CODEBASE (FOR NEXT BUILD):
=========================================

1. electron/main.ts
   → Fixed line 269-271: Added platform detection for Python path
   → Fixed line 357-359: Added platform detection for Python path
   → Now uses: venv\Scripts\python.exe on Windows
   → Now uses: venv/bin/python on Linux/Mac

QUICK FIX FOR YOUR WINDOWS MACHINE:
===================================

Step 1: Copy these files to Windows installation folder:
   - windows-hotfix.bat
   - windows-diagnostic.bat
   - windows-path-fix.js
   - HOTFIX_README.md

Step 2: Open Command Prompt as Administrator:
   cd "C:\Program Files\CreatorCrafter"
   node windows-path-fix.js

Step 3: Run the setup:
   Right-click windows-hotfix.bat → Run as Administrator
   Wait 10-15 minutes for completion

Step 4: Restart CreatorCrafter

WHAT WAS WRONG:
==============

Bug 1: Python Path
   - App looked for: appRoot/venv/bin/python (Linux path)
   - Should be: appRoot\venv\Scripts\python.exe (Windows)
   - Fixed in: electron/main.ts lines 269-271, 357-359

Bug 2: Python Environment
   - NSIS installer script should create venv during install
   - But if user skips or it fails, no venv exists
   - Hotfix creates it manually

NEXT BUILD WILL HAVE:
====================

✓ Fixed Python paths (already done in main.ts)
✓ Cross-platform path detection
✓ Works on Windows, Mac, Linux

You can rebuild now with: ./build.sh win
The new installer will work correctly!

DISTRIBUTING THE HOTFIX:
========================

Option 1: Send hotfix package
   - Zip up the 5 hotfix files
   - Send to affected users
   - Users follow HOTFIX_README.md

Option 2: Rebuild and redistribute
   - Run: sudo rm -rf dist dist-electron release
   - Run: ./build.sh win
   - New installer has the fix
   - Distribute new installer

TESTING:
=======

After applying hotfix on Windows:
1. Open CreatorCrafter
2. Import a video file
3. Click "Analyze Video" - should work
4. Try "Generate SFX" - should work
5. Check venv exists at: C:\Program Files\CreatorCrafter\venv\

SUPPORT QUESTIONS:
=================

Q: Do I need to rebuild?
A: Yes, if you want to fix it permanently. The hotfix is temporary.

Q: Can users apply this themselves?
A: Yes! HOTFIX_README.md has step-by-step instructions.

Q: What if Node.js isn't installed on Windows?
A: They can skip windows-path-fix.js and do manual edit instead.

Q: How big is the download?
A: Hotfix scripts are tiny. Python packages download ~500MB.

Q: Can I automate this in the installer?
A: Yes, but the NSIS script needs debugging. The path fix is already done.

FILES TO COPY TO WINDOWS:
=========================

Essential:
✓ windows-hotfix.bat (Python setup)
✓ HOTFIX_README.md (instructions)

Optional but helpful:
✓ windows-diagnostic.bat (diagnostics)
✓ windows-path-fix.js (auto-patcher)
✓ WINDOWS_HOTFIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md (technical details)

NEXT STEPS FOR YOU:
==================

1. Test the next build:
   sudo rm -rf dist dist-electron release
   ./build.sh win

2. Install on Windows and verify it works without hotfix

3. If it works, you're done! Distribute new installer.

4. If it still fails, apply hotfix and report what's wrong.
